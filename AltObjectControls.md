AltObjectControls can be created and managed by [[CursorEvents]] (see `enableMouseEvents`) so generally you will **not need to instantiate this class directly**.

AltObjectControls extends ObjectControls, an open-source library for controlling ThreeJS objects using a mouse or other input device, to work with Altspace cursor events. The advantage of using AltObjectControls is your app will respond appropriately to both cursor events when running in Altspace and mouse events when running the web browser.
