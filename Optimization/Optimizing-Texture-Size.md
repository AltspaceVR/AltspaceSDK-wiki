Large textures can cause hitching which is particularly unpleasant in VR.

Avoid using large textures if you can get away with smaller ones. Generally speaking, texture size should be proportaional to the size of the object in game.

Note: The texture size represents all the textures you have ever renderered into the scene, even if you stop using the texture later in the app's lifetime.
