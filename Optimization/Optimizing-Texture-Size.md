Large textures can cause hitching which is particularly unpleasant in VR.

Avoid using large textures if you can get away with smaller ones. Generally speaking, texture size should be proportaional to the ojbect of the size in relm.

Note: The texture size represents all the textures you have ever renderered into the scene, even if you stop using the texture later in the app's lifetime.
