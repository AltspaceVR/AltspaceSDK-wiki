Increased triangle count requires additional GPU resources to render. 
Avoid high-resolution models. Decimate models before importing them in your app. Delete any hidden geometry. 

Note: The triangle count represents triangles of all the geometries you have ever renderered into the scene, even if you stop using the geometry later in the app's lifetime.
