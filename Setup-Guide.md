>_We find this the easiest way to develop VR web apps for AltspaceVR, but feel free to substitute other tools or experiment with developing in VR mode. You can also skip the AltspaceVR step if you would rather develop using WebGL in a traditional web browser._

###Launch and configure AltspaceVR
1. Launch and login to AltspaceVR without an HMD connected
2. After the program is running, switch AltspaceVR into windowed mode
 OSX: Left-Command <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd>
Altspace is running: **left-command (OSX) / left-ctrl (Win) + left-alt + W** (on Windows... known issue: the Altspace window may go blank/blue when switching to windowed mode, just use the shortcut twice more to toggle to full-screen then back again.)
