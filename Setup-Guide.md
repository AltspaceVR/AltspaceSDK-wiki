>_We find this the easiest way to develop VR web apps for AltspaceVR, but feel free to substitute other tools or experiment with developing in VR mode. You can also skip the AltspaceVR step if you would rather develop using WebGL in a traditional web browser._

###Configure AltspaceVR
1. Launch and login to AltspaceVR without an HMD connected
2. After the program is running, switch AltspaceVR into windowed mode  
 OSX: <kbd>Left Command</kbd>+<kbd>Left ALT</kbd>+<kbd>W</kbd>  
 Win: <kbd>Left CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>Left ALT</kbd>+<kbd>W</kbd>  
>On windows, if the window remains black, you may need to snap or resize it a couple times for an image to appear  
###Setup Coding Environment
1. Checkout (or download and unzip) this repo to your project folder
1. Download and run [Sublime Text]
1. Drag your project folder into Sublime
1. Download and run [Prepros]
1. Drag your project folder into Prepros
###Test Example
1. Copy the URL and paste it into the URL bar of the Apps panel in Altspace
>Using the apps panel is recommended as it has the same dimensions as all the public enclosures in AltspaceVR so you do not need to currently worry about creating responsive holographic applications.
