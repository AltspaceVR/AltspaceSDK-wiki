Deploy your Altspace App on Dropbox, Amazon S3, or any web host.  

* **Github Pages** - If your project is already in GitHub, you can also host directly from your GitHub repository using GitHub Pages, as described in their step-by-step [tutorial](https://pages.github.com/).  For example, the AltspaceSDK examples are hosted using GitHub pages: [spinning-cube.html](http://altspacevr.github.io/AltspaceSDK/examples/spinning-cube.html)

  > Tip: Put all your project assets in your repo, or if hosted on a remote server, set the THREE.Loader "crossOrigin" parameter to "anonymous" and [enable cross-origin resource sharing](http://enable-cors.org/) (CORS) on your asset server.
