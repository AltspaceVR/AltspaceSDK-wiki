This page describes the typical workflow for developing an Altspace Web App.

Hardware Requirements
* DK2 (optional, but no DK1)
* Dedicated GPU (for high-performance graphics)
* integrated graphics not currently supported, but may work

Note the above requirements are for developing Altspace apps, not merely running Altspace, which can be done on computers without a dedicated GPU.  The additional graphics power is needed when developing apps since you will also be running additional debugging tools, described below.

Development Tools
* [Prepros]: Web development tool that automatically reloads a page when the source code changes.
* [Sublime Text Editor]: Recommended, but you can use any editor or IDE that supports Javascript.

Debugging
* Coherent Debugger: Allows you to see the console output of your Altspace web app (download link?)
* Resources Folder: location?
* Error Logs: location on Mac and Windows?
