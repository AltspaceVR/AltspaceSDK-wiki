* Ability to see more debug info from altspace (which objects are in the hierarchy, do they have anything displayed, what things are actually loaded).
* Ability to hide an object after loading it (maybe by adding Object3D.visible to data serialized by AltRenderer)
* Events triggered when user Enters/Leaves/Moves within the enclosure, along with position (e.g. camera position).
* Support more Three.js features: Changing materials, Transparent materials, Visibility
* Spatialized audio tags
* Better physics reps
* Enable avatar collisions on selected holograms, so avatars cannot walk through and can climb onto them
