* ~~Support holding down mouse-click on hologram and moving mouse *without* turning the camera.~~
* Support for basic per-texel alpha on mesh when texture has alpha channel.

* Ability to create/render colored text in 3D space (with the option to billboard it to the user)
* ~~Ability to get current Altspace user's current headposition specified in "enclosure" coordinate space.~~
* Ability to create/render "beams" (two end points, a color and perhaps a width)
* Ability to see more debug info from altspace (which objects are in the hierarchy, do they have anything displayed, what things are actually loaded).
* Ability to hide an object after loading it (maybe by adding Object3D.visible to data serialized by AltRenderer)
* Events triggered when user Enters/Leaves/Moves within the enclosure, along with position (e.g. camera position).
* Support more Three.js features: Changing materials, Transparent materials, Visibility
* Spatialized audio tags
